# PREVAIL 
## a Polynomial-Runtime EBPF Verifier using an Abstract Interpretation Layer

A new eBPF verifier.

The project resides on https://github.com/vbpf/ebpf-verifier/tree/assert-bits

The artifact contains two independent sub-artifacts: a verification tool, and a
set of real-world eBPF programs used for development and evaluation of the tool.
The source for the tool is in the `src` directory. The benchmarks are in ELF
files in the directory `ebpf-samples`. Each ELF file contains one or more
programs, in different sections of the file.

## Getting Started
Evaluation can be done either on an Ubuntu machine, or the supplied VM.
(the tool can also run on a Mac, but the memory measurements will always return 0).

### Dependencies from vanilla Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential git cmake libboost-dev libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev g++-8
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-tk
pip3 install matplotlib   # for plotting the graphs
```

Clone, make and run:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/vbpf/ebpf-verifier.git -b assert-bits
cd ebpf-verifier
make crab_install
make
```

### VM
The VM supplied requires VMware Player:
https://www.vmware.com/il/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html

The user is `prevail`, password is also `prevail`.

The VM memory should be adjusted to the maximum available for the host.
The terminal is already configured to start from the right path, `~/ebpf-verifier`.

### 

Example:
```
ebpf-verifier$ ./check ebpf-samples/cilium/bpf_lxc.o 2/1 --domain=zoneCrab
1,0.062802,21792
```
The output is three comma-separated values:
* 1 or 0, for "pass" and "fail" respectively
* The runtime of the fixpoint algorithm (in seconds)
* The peak memory consumption, in kb, as reflected by the resident-set size (rss)

Usage:
```
ebpf-verifier$ ./check -h
A new eBPF verifier
Usage: ./check [OPTIONS] path [section]

Positionals:
  path FILE REQUIRED          Elf file to analyze
  section SECTION             Section to analyze

Options:
  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit
  -l                          List sections
  -d,--dom,--domain DOMAIN    Abstract domain
  -v                          Print invariants
  --asm FILE                  Print disassembly to FILE
  --dot FILE                  Export cfg to dot FILE
```

A standard alternative to the --asm flag is `llvm-objdump -S FILE`.

The cfg can be viewed using `dot` and the standard PDF viewer:
```
ebpf-verifier$ ./check ebpf-samples/cilium/bpf_lxc.o 2/1 --domain=zoneCrab --dot cfg.dot
ebpf-verifier$ dot -Tpdf cfg.dot > cfg.pdf
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

To get the results for described in Figures 10 and 11, run the following:
```
ebpf-verifier$ scripts/runperf.sh ebpf-samples interval zoneCrab zoneElina octElina polyElina | tee results.csv
```
The first argument to the script, `ebpf-samples`, is the root directory in which
to search for elf files. You can pass any subdirectory or file, e.g.
`ebpd-samples/linux`.

The rest of the positional arguments are the numerical domains to use.

The output is a large `csv` file. The first line is a header:
```
suite,project,file,section,hash,instructions,loads,stores,jumps,joins,interval?,interval_sec,interval_kb,zoneCrab?,zoneCrab_sec,zoneCrab_kb,zoneElina?,zoneElina_sec,zoneElina_kb,octElina?,octElina_sec,octElina_kb,polyElina?,polyElina_sec,polyElina_kb
ebpf-samples,cilium,bpf_lxc.o,2/1,69a5e4fc57ca1c94,41,6,10,1,1,1,0.047696,8484,1,0.057409,21796,1,0.0948671,19192,1,0.100129,24196,1,0.12144,18732
```
* _suite_ in our case will be "ebpf-samples"
* _project_ is one of the directories in the suite. We currently have `bpf_cilium_test`, `cilium` `linux`, `ovs`,  `prototype-kernel` and  `suricata`
* _file_ is the elf file containing the programs. The compiled version of a C file
* _section_ is the elf section containing the program checked
* _hash_ is a unique hash of the eBPF code. There are duplicate programs in the benchmark (since we use files from projects "as-is"). To count the real number of programs these duplicates should be removed
* _instructions_, _loads_, _stores_, _jumps_ and _joins_ show the number of these features
* For each domain DOM, there are 3 consecutive columns:
    * "DOM?" is 0 for rejected program, 1 for accepted program
    * "DOM_sec" is the number of seconds that the fixpoint operation took
    * "DOM_kb" is the peak memory resident set size consumed by the analysis, and is an estimate for the amount of additional memory needed by the analysis  

Note that in the full benchmark, exactly 2 programs should be rejected by `zoneCrab`, our domain of choice. Other domain reject different number of programs.

Any subset of the available domains is valid. So in order to compare the two different
implementations of the `zone` domain, one can run
```
ebpf-verifier$ scripts/runperf.sh ebpf-samples/linux zoneCrab zoneElina | results.csv
ebpf-verifier$ python3 scripts/makeplot.py results.csv stores
```
The script `ebpf-verifier$ python3 scripts/makeplot.py` takes a csv file in the format described above, and the key to plot against (usually instructions or stores) and plots two graphs: on showing runtime as a function of the number of stores, and the other is the memory consumption as a function of the number of stores.

While the paper states that the runtime is quadratic, the results are
expected to be nearly linear for all the domains - except probably the domain
`octElina` which does not show consistent runtime characteristics.

Note that the number of programs is slightly different from the numbers presented in Section 7.1 (benchmarks). The precise numbers depend on how one count duplicate programs (as can be found using the hash column in the resulting csv file), the addition of a new repository (prototype-kernel) and removal of variation on existing repository (ovs-noprint). Also, we did not count programs smaller than certain size.

### Caveat
When performed on a VM without sufficient memory, some analyses of some domains
are terminated by the OS due to insufficient memory, resulting in "-1" runtime
and skewing the graph. To avoid this, the failing cases should be omitted.

4GB RAM should be enough for `zoneCrab`, our domain of choice, but other domains
may require much more than that. To reproduce the results as will be published
in the final version, it is recommended to use bare-metal Linux machine. 

## Testing the Linux verifier

The file `load_bpf` is a simple tool that loads the contents of an elf file to the system. It must be ran using `sudo` (the password for the VM is `prevail`):
```
sudo counter/load_bpf ebpf-samples/linux/cpustat_kern.o 
ebpf-samples/linux/cpustat_kern.o
	tracepoint/power/cpu_idle,stat,114,0.000176,
	tracepoint/power/cpu_frequency,stat,81,0.000101,
	loaded
```

## Counter and Artificial examples

The folder `counter/` contains other examples used to demonstrate the usefulness of our tools, compared to the existing verifier. To compile the examples, run 
```
ebpf-verifier$ make -C counter
ebpf-verifier$ scripts/runperf.sh counter/objects zoneCrab
```

Two examples of real-world false positive are taken from the Linux samples suite.
The file `xdp_tx_iptunnel_kern.o` is valid and passes both the Linux tool and ours.
However, in the original source code there are redundant loads from memory to a varaible holding the same value. These were added happen due to untracked register spilling that led to false positive. Two fixes are compiled into `xdp_tx_iptunnel_1_kern.o` and `xdp_tx_iptunnel_2_kern.o`. Both pass our verifier (without any special effort) but fail the existing one:
```
$ ./check counter/objects/xdp_tx_iptunnel_2_kern.o
1,0.314213,86740
$ counter/load_bpf counter/objects/xdp_tx_iptunnel_2_kern.o
<... long trace reporting an alleged failure>
```

### Double-strncmp experiment
This experiment demonstrates exponential blowup in the Linux verifier, versus linear runtime in our tool. A simplified version of the code is described in Example 3.4, Figure 1 and Figure 12. Be sure to run with `sudo`, since Linux requires special permissions for this.
```
ebpf-verifier$ sudo scripts/experiment.sh | tee blowup.csv
ebpf-verifier$ python3 scripts/makeplot.py blowup.csv iterations False
```

### Programs with loops
There are several simple programs with loops in the folder `counter/src`, called `simple_loop_*.c` and `manual_memset*.c`. The current verifier rejects them immediately:
```
sudo ./load_bpf counter/objects/simple_loop_ptr_backwards.o 
counter/objects/simple_loop_ptr_backwards.o
	sk_skb/loop-ptr,bpf_load_program(prog_cnt=0) err=22
back-edge from insn 7 to 5
```

Using our tool, the safety (but not termination) of some loop-based programs can be verified:
```
$ ./check counter/objects/simple_loop_ptr_backwards.o
1,0.018346,7900
```
(not all the programs in the folder are verified)

### Important components:

The analyzer code is divided to two main parts: front end, parsing eBPF binaries into CFG, and backend, translating the eBPF CFG into crab-specific CFG of constraints.

The front end (files named `asm_*`) is potentially reusable by any other analyzer or tool for eBPF. The most important file is `src/asm_syntax.hpp`, which describes the syntax of the language in a relatively self-explanatory way (structs and variant types).

The backend is mostly confined into `src/crab_verifier.cpp` and `src/crab_constraints.cpp`. The latter does the translation of eBPF instructions to the language handled by crab.
